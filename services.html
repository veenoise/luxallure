                <ul>
                    <li>Acne scars are the result of the skin's healing response to acne lesions. When acne lesions, such as pimples, cysts, or nodules, penetrate deep into the skin, the body produces collagen fibers to repair the damage. However, the resulting scar tissue may look different from the surrounding skin, and can be raised, pitted, or discolored.</li>
                    <li>Acne scars can have a significant impact on a person's appearance, self-esteem, and overall quality of life. They can be permanent and difficult to conceal, and may serve as a reminder of past acne breakouts. </li>

                    <li>Pimple marks or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) can be a source of frustration and embarrassment for those affected, as they can be difficult to conceal and may take some time to fade on their own. The marks can also negatively impact a person's self-esteem and confidence.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="landing-options main-sub">

                </ul>
